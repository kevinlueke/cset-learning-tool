# The CSET Learning Tool
## Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology CSET program capstone project
### Developed by: Steve Eckles, Kevin Leuke, and Kate Mundale

The CSET Learning Tool is a web app built with React using the Next.js framework.
The goal of this project was to apply many of the skills we learned during the CSET
program to a complete project. We decided to also use the opportunity to learn brand-new skills,
React and Next.js, in order to challenge ourselves and expand our exposure to modern
technologies.
